          <h2>STORYBOARD INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p>
            “No man is the same as another” and, as such, he is constantly
            shaped and influenced by his experiences. This may be considered as
            the main reason why the visual style, that has been adopted to
            re-create the storyboard for the script of one of the main scene of
            Blade Runner, is so different from the hundreds that have been
            featured by many storyboard artists along the years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Quick pencil drawings, computer graphics or dedicated 3D
            storyboarding software are between the most used techniques but
            moving towards the different panels of the storyboard “Blade Runner
            – Between Worlds” the viewer could be easily impressed by the unique
            choice of style. Predominant black with people and things shaped by
            white lines.

          <p>
            Voight-Kampff dial. It stands for the robotic element in a world
            where everything appears to be human after all. Indeed, the machine
            appears to be in good contrast with the main characters presented
            but a clear-eyed viewer could catch sight of the presence of the
            same color in the first panel introducing Leon. This is where things
            start to suggest that our tattooed Japanese man is a machine himself
            indeed and the audience would finally find out in the last cuts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Storyboard artists like Charles Ratteray and producers such as
            Ridley Scott have been taken in consideration even though the
            Nipponic element comes from personal cultural background. Also, a
            great source of inspiration was the movie “2046” by Wong Kar-wai.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second, third and final panels have some scenes for building
            tension. This tension is contained in a climatic fight between Leon
            and Holden, each one of them represents worlds different from one
            another. Some great westerns have been built around this idea and
            indeed Sergio Leone’s unique movie “The Good the Bad and the Ugly” –
            with its elements of gamesmanship and revenge – has been a great
            source of inspiration.
